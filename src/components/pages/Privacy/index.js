              <B>In Short:</B> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol
              (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is
              collected automatically when you visit our App.
            </p>
            <p>
              We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use
              or navigate the App. This information does not reveal your
              specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
              include device and usage information, such as your IP address,
              browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
              preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location,
              information about how and when you use our App and other technical
              information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the
              security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics
              and reporting purposes.

                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
                diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers
                automatically collect when you access or use our App and which
                we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us,
                this log data may include your IP address, device information,
                browser type and settings and information about your activity in
                the App (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
                usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you
                take such as which features you use), device event information
                (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash
                dumps') and hardware settings).

                our App, subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, we
                will collect personal information from you. You can opt-out of

            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

              currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
